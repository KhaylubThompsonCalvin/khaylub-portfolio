// Camera choreography — one keyframed "shot" per stage, sampled by scrollProgress.
// The Wanderer walks in place at the origin (+X = his facing). The camera moves
// around him so the journey reads through composition:
//   behind (arrival) -> eases back (philosophy) -> swings to his side (focus)
//   -> orbits to his FRONT as he arrives (discovery) -> holds, off-centre so the
//   project cards get the other half (exploration) -> cranes up at the close (contact).
// All values in metres/world space. He is ~1.0m tall (head 0.98). Tuned live in-browser.
